# About Microreact

## What is Microreact?
Microreact allows you to upload, visualise and explore any combination of clustering (trees, networks), geographic (map) and temporal (timeline) data. Other metadata variables are displayed in a table. You can specify colours and/or shapes to display on the map, tree and/or timeline. A permanent URL is produced for you to share your Microreact or a `.microreact` file can be downloaded for sharing with collaborators

## Support for Microreact
The code in this repository is used to drive the [microreact.org](https://microreact.org) website which is the primary way for users to access its functionality. We provide support for microreact.org via
 * email [support@microreact.org](mailto:support@microreact.org)
 * [helpdesk](https://gitlab.com/cgps/microreact/support/-/issues) 

The code is provided under the MIT licence. It is provided as is and we do not have the resource to provide assistance for installation or enhancing features using the source code.

### Private data and local installation
We recognise that there are circumstances where uploading private data may comprise a breach of information governance policy or represent privacy concern. When you upload data on the [upload page](https://microreact.org/upload) no data leaves the browser on your computer. If you choose to save a project and select the 'Download as a `.microreact` file' option then no data is sent to external servers and you can share this file via secure means with other users.
However if you would like the ability to save projects on a centralised server then local installation is an option. Please contact us via [support@microreact.org](mailto:support@microreact.org) to discuss.
