# About Microreact

## What is Microreact?

Microreact allows you to upload, visualise and explore any combination of clustering (trees, networks), geographic (map) and temporal (timeline) data. Other metadata variables are displayed in a table. You can specify colours and/or shapes to display on the map, tree and/or timeline. A permanent URL is produced for you to share your Microreact or a `.microreact` file can be downloaded for sharing with collaborators

The code is provided under the MIT licence. It is provided as is and we do not have the resource to provide assistance for installation or enhancing features using the source code.
